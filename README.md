## 📝 Notes:
- The personal portfolio itself links to the rest of the projects in section *01. Projects*.
- ***short review:*** The course is free and it really encourages you to get your  hands dirty. These are probably the best aspects of this course. You get to understand fundamentals and solidify understanding of CSS. However, I would say there were a few "best practices" that were not mentioned or used. Small bits of the course felt stale and outdated.
