                <p>
                    J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904&dash;1967) was an influential
                    American theoretical physicist known for his early
                    contributions to quantum mechanics. During World War II, he
                    played a pivotal role as the scientific director of the
                    Manhattan Project, overseeing the development of the atomic
                    bomb. After the war, Oppenheimer became an advocate for
                    international control of nuclear weapons but faced
                    controversy and a security clearance revocation during the
                    Red Scare. Despite his postwar contributions to academia and
                    efforts toward arms control, his legacy is marked by the
                    dual nature of his impact—both as a brilliant scientist and
                    a central figure in the development of destructive nuclear
                    weaponry.
